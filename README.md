##Arduino TTL Gate Tester

I designed this project due to many of the IC's in the digital system design lab at my school not functioning. I would build my circuit only to find that something such as the AND IC that I was using had been burnt up. I used this to test the ICs before implamenting my design to avoid having to troubleshoot broken ICs once the circuit was built. An Arduino Uno with a LCD display and two buttons is used to navigate the menus and display the test results. I used shift registers to hook up the LCD due to running out of pins on the Arduino.
